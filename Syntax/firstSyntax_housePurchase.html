// Solutions / Notes
// 1. Close the prompt call for current savings:
//    const currentSavings = parseFloat(prompt("Current savings balance:"));
// 2. Close the condition parenthesis:
//    if (monthlySavingsTarget <= 0) {
// 3. Close the alert call:
//    alert(summaryMessage);
// 4. Translate the Python snippet into JavaScript:
//    // Students sometimes paste their old Python here
//    if (remaining <= 0) {
//        alert("You're ready to buy!");
//    } else if (monthsNeeded < 12) {
//        alert("Less than a year away!");
//    } else {
//        alert("Keep saving every month!");
//    }
